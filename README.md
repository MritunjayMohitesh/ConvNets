# ConvNets


This repository contains two implementations of CNN:
cnn_basic contains the implementation of CNN from scratch using for loops. It contains code only till forward propagation. Backward propagation can be implemented using standard optimizers as defined in various deep learning frameworks.
cnn_with_tensorflow contains CNN implementation with tensorflow using some standard functions
